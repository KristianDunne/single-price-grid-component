# Frontend Mentor - Single Price Grid Component

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my solution to a coding challenge by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io

## The challenge

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action
